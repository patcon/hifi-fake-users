# Test Cypress Audio

The purpose of the repo is to see if we can run a cypress on GitHub Actions,
such that it mock a microphone audio device with a test file.

The reason for investigating this is to see whether GitHub Actions and Cypress
could be used to create persistent fake users in a High Fidelity space.

This would allow push-button access to having fake users in spaces, like:
- DJs who play music for an hour and then leave
- Ocean wave sounds coming from a beach
- Koisk-like narration of spaces or exhibits
- Stretch goal: Automated walking tours of spaces
